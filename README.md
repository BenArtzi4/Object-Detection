# Object Detection and Tracking Program

Welcome to the Object Detection and Tracking program, written in Python!

This program activates the camera on the computer and sets the first image captured as the background. It then detects the appearance and disappearance of objects in the camera's field of view and exports a CSV file with the times of their appearance and disappearance.
